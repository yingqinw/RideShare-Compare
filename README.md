# RideShare Compare

**Basic Information**

Our web app is a RideShare Price Comparison tool that allows you input your pickup and drop off destinations, and see the different prices of the prominent RideShare companies like Uber and Lyft. Right now it is very cumbersome for the user to compare all prices individually, and so our Price Compare app will ensure the user is getting the cheapest ride to their destination.

**To host the web application:**

Import this repository into Eclipse first. This project provides everything needed to host the web application on a local web server.
On Eclipse, right-click "run.launch" -> Run As -> "run". It will be hosted on https://localhost:8080.
